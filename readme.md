## Credit

I don't know where I got the file /assets/tiles.png from. I started this project when CC171 (see link above) was published, and then didn't finish it until today.

The only source I found when searching Google Images was the link above (Image source - user CHROM).

## TODO

* Implement flood fill, instead of picking squares randomly
